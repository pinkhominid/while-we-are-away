- First thing in the morning
- Every 1-2 hrs

### Food
- A cup of food 3-4 times through the day
- Fresh water all day
  - Not too much in the evening (Eden too!)

### Treats
- Lots of treats, don't be stingy
- BUT only for good behavior
- If you want him to do something, use treats!
- If he needs a good distraction,
  cream cheese rubber toy in his cage

### Play
- Be prepared! Before you play..
  - Bring a partner
  - Have toys to distract
  - If bitey, see below
- Toys
  - Change toys daily to keep him interested

### Exercise

### Biting

1. Stand up
1. "Sit"
1. Call for help, partner distracts him with toy
1. Go behind gate
1. Wait a moment till he calms
1. Come back
